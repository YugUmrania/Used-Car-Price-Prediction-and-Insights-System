# Used Car Price Prediction and Insights System

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Used Car Price Prediction and Insights System** is a machine learning–based project developed as part of the **Semester Guided Project (SGP)**.
The goal of this system is to **predict the resale price of used cars** and provide meaningful insights into the used car market using historical vehicle data.

The prediction is based on important vehicle attributes such as:

* Brand
* Model
* Manufacturing Year
* Age of the car
* Kilometers driven
* Fuel type
* Transmission type
* Ownership history

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Perform **data integration** from multiple datasets
* Clean and preprocess real-world used car data
* Analyze pricing trends using **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**
* Build **machine learning models** to predict car prices
* Provide insights helpful for **buyers, sellers, and businesses**

---

## 🗂 Dataset Information

This project uses **two used-car datasets** that were:

1. **Merged and integrated**
2. **Cleaned and standardized**
3. Prepared for further **encoding and feature engineering**

Current progress:

* ✅ Data collection completed
* ✅ Data integration completed
* ✅ Data cleaning & preprocessing completed
* ⏳ Categorical encoding in progress
* ⏳ Feature engineering pending
* ⏳ Model training pending
* ⏳ Deployment pending

---

## ⚙️ Data Preprocessing Steps

The following preprocessing tasks have been performed:

* Handling missing values
* Removing duplicates
* Standardizing column names
* Converting categorical text to lowercase for consistency
* Creating derived features such as **car age**
* Preparing a **final cleaned dataset** for modeling

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Workflow (Upcoming)

The next stages of the project include:

* Encoding categorical variables
* Feature selection and engineering
* Training regression models such as:

  * Linear Regression
  * Random Forest Regressor
  * Decision Tree Regressor
  * Gradient Boosting (if applicable)
* Model evaluation using:

  * MAE
  * RMSE
  * R² Score
