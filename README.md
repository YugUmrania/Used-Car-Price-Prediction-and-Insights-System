## 📌 Project Overview

The **Used Car Price Prediction and Insights System** is a Machine Learning–based project developed as part of the **Semester Guided Project (SGP)**.

The goal of this system is to:

- Predict the resale price of used cars
- Analyze pricing trends
- Provide meaningful insights into the used car market

The prediction is based on important vehicle attributes such as:

- Brand  
- Model  
- Manufacturing Year  
- Age of the car  
- Kilometers driven  
- Fuel type  
- Transmission type  
- Ownership history  

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Perform **data integration** from multiple datasets  
- Clean and preprocess real-world used car data  
- Conduct **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- Build accurate **regression models**  
- Provide actionable insights for **buyers, sellers, and businesses**

---

## 🗂 Dataset Information

This project uses **two used-car datasets** that were:

1. Merged and integrated  
2. Cleaned and standardized  
3. Prepared for encoding and feature engineering  

### ✅ Current Progress

- ✔ Data collection completed  
- ✔ Data integration completed  
- ✔ Data cleaning & preprocessing completed  
- ⏳ Categorical encoding in progress  
- ⏳ Feature engineering pending  
- ⏳ Model training pending  
- ⏳ Deployment pending  

---

## ⚙️ Data Preprocessing

The following preprocessing tasks were performed:

- Handling missing values  
- Removing duplicates  
- Standardizing column names  
- Converting categorical values to lowercase  
- Creating derived features such as **car age**  
- Preparing final cleaned dataset for modeling  

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Workflow

The upcoming ML stages include:

- Encoding categorical variables  
- Feature selection and engineering  
- Training regression models such as:

  - Linear Regression  
  - Decision Tree Regressor  
  - Random Forest Regressor  
  - Gradient Boosting (if applicable)  

- Model evaluation using:

  - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)  
  - RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)  
  - R² Score
